        <h1>Privacy Policy for StudyLocus</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 7, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to StudyLocus ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our web application (the "Service").
        </p>
        <p>
            By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect information in a few different ways to provide and improve our Service.</p>

        <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Account Information:</strong> When you choose to sign in using Google, we use Firebase Authentication. We receive your basic Google profile information (name, email, photo) to create and identify your account.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Your Personal Data:</strong> The Service is designed to be your personal dashboard. To enable features like cross-device sync, the application saves the data you create to a secure cloud database (Firebase Firestore). This data includes your to-do lists, notes, test scores, study logs, custom card layouts, and app settings. This data is treated as your private property.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Usage Data (Analytics):</strong> We use Google Analytics to collect information about how you interact with our Service. This may include your IP address (often anonymized), browser type, device type, pages visited, and the time and date of your visits. We use this data to understand how our Service is being used and to make improvements.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Local Storage Data:</strong> The app uses your browser's `localStorage` to save a copy of your data (like your card layout and content) directly on your device. This allows the app to load quickly and work offline. This data is not sent to us unless you are signed in, at which point it is synced with your secure cloud account.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>We Do Not Access Your Content:</strong> Your personal data (tasks, notes, test scores, logs) is your own. We do not access, view, or analyze this content for any purpose. All data storage and syncing is automated and is not monitored by us.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>To Provide and Sync Your Service:</strong> The *only* use of your personal data is to securely store it in your private cloud account (Firebase Firestore) and automatically sync it across any devices where you are logged in.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>To Personalize Your Experience:</strong> We use your saved settings (`settings`) to customize the app's theme, font, and layout to your preferences.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>To Maintain and Improve Our Service:</strong> We use anonymous Google Analytics data to identify bugs, understand user behavior, and improve the app's features and performance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>To Authenticate You:</strong> We use your Google Account information via Firebase Authentication to securely log you in and verify your identity.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How We Share Your Information</h2>
        <p>
            We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We never share your personal user-generated content (notes, tasks, etc.) with anyone. Your information is shared only in the following limited and technical circumstances:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We use Google (Firebase and Google Analytics) as a third-party service provider to host our database, authenticate users, and process analytics. These providers are bound by their own privacy policies and are not permitted to use your personal information for any other purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>For Legal Reasons:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
            Your user-generated content and account information are stored securely on Google's Firebase Firestore servers. We rely on the robust security measures provided by Google to protect your data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data stored in your browser's `localStorage` is only as secure as the device and browser you are using.
        </p>
        <p>
            While we and our service providers take reasonable measures to protect your information, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Your Data Rights and Choices</h2>

        <h3>Accessing and Updating Your Information</h3>
        <p>
            You can access, add, delete, and modify all of your user-generated content (notes, tasks, logs, etc.) directly within the StudyLocus application at any time. Your basic account information (name, email) is managed through your Google Account.
        </p>

        <h3>Data Deletion</h3>
        <p>
            You can delete individual pieces of content (like cards or to-do items) directly in the app. If you wish to permanently delete your entire account and all associated data from our database, please contact us at the email address listed below. We will process your request in a timely manner.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Opting-Out of Analytics</h3>
        <p>
            You can opt-out of Google Analytics data collection by using browser plugins like the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on or by configuring your browser's privacy settings (e.g., "Do Not Track").
        </p>

        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Our Service relies on the following third-party services, which have their own privacy policies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Google (Firebase & Google Analytics):</strong>
                <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Google Fonts:</strong>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
